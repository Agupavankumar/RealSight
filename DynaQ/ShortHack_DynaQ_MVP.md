# üß† In-House Ad and Survey SDK

## üöÄ Project Overview

This SDK is designed to be integrated into React-based web applications to:
- Dynamically load and display ads.
- Track user interactions (clicks, hovers, impressions).
- Trigger surveys based on user behavior.
- Send data to a centralized backend for analytics.
- Organize ads and events under project hierarchies for better management and analytics.
- The SDK is modular and reusable across multiple internal projects.

## üéØ MVP Goals

1. Replace third-party tools like Optimizely for ad delivery and tracking.
2. Integrate survey functionality similar to Qualtrics.
3. Provide a unified SDK for use across all internal React projects.
4. Enable centralized analytics and feedback collection.
5. Implement project-based organization of ads and their associated events.

## üß© Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 1. `<AdContainer />`
- **Description**: Renders ads dynamically based on `adId`.
- **Props**:
  - `adId` (string): Unique identifier for the ad to be displayed.
  - `projectId` (string): Project identifier this ad belongs to.
  - `onClick` (function): Callback function for click events.
- **Behavior**:
  - Fetches ad metadata from the backend using project context.
  - Displays the ad content.
  - Tracks impressions and clicks automatically with project attribution.

### 2. `<SurveyPopup />`
- **Description**: Displays a modal survey triggered by user behavior.
- **Props**:
  - `surveyId` (string): Unique identifier for the survey.
  - `projectId` (string): Project identifier this survey belongs to.

  - Displays survey questions and collects responses.
  - Submits responses to the backend.

### 3. `useInteractionTracker()`
- **Description**: Custom hook to track user events (clicks, hovers, etc.).
- **API**:
  - `trackEvent(eventType, eventId, projectId)`: Tracks a specific user event within a project context.
- **Behavior**:
  - Sends event data to the backend for analytics.
  - Automatically associates events with their parent ad and project.

### 4. `useSurveyTrigger()`
- **Description**: Hook to determine when to show a survey.
- **API**:
  - `useSurveyTrigger({ trigger, threshold, projectId })`: Returns a boolean indicating whether to show the survey.
- **Behavior**:
  - Evaluates rules like time on page, number of clicks, etc.
  - Determines if the survey should be triggered.

### 5. `<ProjectDashboard />`
- **Description**: Admin interface for managing projects and their assets.
- **Features**:
  - Project creation with automatic ID generation
  - Ad management within projects
  - Event tracking and analytics by project
  - Performance metrics at project and ad levels

## üèóÔ∏è MVP Architecture Overview

### Frontend SDK
- React-based components and hooks.
- Distributed as a private NPM package.
- **Project Context Provider**:
  - Wraps application to provide project context to all components
  - Automatically injects project ID into all tracking events

### Backend Services (in .NET)
- **ProjectService**: Manages project creation and configuration.
- **AdService**: Serves ads based on rules and project context.
- **TrackingService**: Logs user interactions with project and ad attribution.
- **SurveyService**: Manages survey logic and responses.
- **AnalyticsService**: Aggregates and exposes metrics by project.

### Database
- SQL Server for structured data with project-centric schema.
- Redis for caching.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The following schema is designed for SQL Server and optimized for project-centric queries and analytics.

**Tables:**

- **projects**:  
  - `id` (UUID, PK)  
  - `name` (string)  
  - `description` (text)  
  - `created_at` (timestamp)  
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

- **ads**:  
  - `id` (UUID, PK)  
  - `project_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí projects.id)  
  - `name` (string)  
  - `content_url` (string)  
  - `metadata` (JSONB)  
  - `created_at` (timestamp)  
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

- **surveys**:  
  - `id` (UUID, PK)  
  - `project_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí projects.id)  
  - `name` (string)  
  - `config` (JSONB)  
  - `created_at` (timestamp)  
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

- **events**:  
  - `id` (UUID, PK)  
  - `project_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí projects.id)  
  - `ad_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí ads.id, nullable)  
  - `event_type` (string)  
  - `user_id` (string or UUID, nullable)  
  - `metadata` (JSONB)  
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

- **survey_responses**:  
  - `id` (UUID, PK)  
  - `survey_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí surveys.id)  
  - `project_id` (UUID, FK ‚Üí projects.id)  
  - `user_id` (string or UUID, nullable)  
  - `responses` (JSONB)  
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

**Relationships:**
- A project has many ads, surveys, events, and survey_responses.
- An ad belongs to a project and has many events.
- A survey belongs to a project and has many survey_responses.
- An event always belongs to a project, and optionally to an ad.
- A survey_response always belongs to a survey and a project.

## ü§ñ AI Agent Notes

- This SDK is intended to be generated as a modular React library.
- Backend should be scaffolded in .NET Core with RESTful APIs.
- Frontend SDK should be published as a private NPM package.
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines for both SDK and backend services.
- All events must be tied to both an ad and a project for proper attribution.
- Database schema should optimize for querying events by project ID.
